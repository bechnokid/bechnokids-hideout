StatusCafe is great, so here's a tutorial on how to make a microblog out of it to put on your own site!

It is possible to modify the CSS in your StatusCafe account and then put it in an iframe, but creating a feed reader allows for more customization, if needed.

If you'd like, you can also [skip straight to the source code](#finished-html)!

## Obtaining StatusCafe's Feed

You can get your StatusCafe feed from the URL below.

`https://status.cafe/users/[YOUR_STATUSCAFE_USERNAME].atom`

Be sure to replace `[YOUR_STATUSCAFE_USERNAME]` with your username in Status Cafe.

## Creating the HTML Element

Somewhere in your HTML code, create an element where the Feed Reader will be. This can be a **div**, **span**, whichever you'd like. The most important thing is to label it, either with an **id** or **class** attribute.

According to the HTML standard, since there will be only one feed reader, I'll be giving it an id attribute called **feed-reader**.

```html
<div id='feed-reader'></div>
```

## Making the Script

Next, we will be creating the script.

Make sure that the script is in a `<script>` tag is below the HTML element you created.

I usually like to put the `<script>` tag right above the `</body>` tag, as shown below:

```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <!-- CODE GOES HERE -->
    <script> // Right here </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Put the following code into the `<script>` tag:

```js/
const feedURL = 'https://status.cafe/users/[YOUR_STATUSCAFE_USERNAME].atom';

fetch(feedURL)
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(str => new window.DOMParser().parseFromString(str, "text/xml"))
  .then(data => {
    const entries = data.querySelectorAll("entry")
  });
```

What this code is doing is converting the feed into XML, which JavaScript can then extract the feed's data. The script then takes all of the posts you created in StatusCafe and stores them into the `entries` variable on **line 7**.

## Preparing the Data

This section will show how to prepare the data of your StatusCafe posts using the stored feed data.

The way how StatusCafe sets up their feeds makes things a little difficult, and it took me a while to figure everything out. Hopefully the next few steps won't be too confusing.

Underneath `const entries = data.querySelectorAll("entry")`, add the following:

```js/
let html = `<p>No statuses yet.</p>`;
if (entries.length > 1){
  entries.forEach(el => {
    let title = el.querySelector("title").innerHTML.slice(0, NUMBER_OF_CHARACTERS).trim();
    let content = el.querySelector("content").textContent.trim();
    let dateString = el.querySelector("published").innerHTML.slice(0, 10);
  });
}
```

This loop takes the data from each StatusCafe post and splits them into different variables that we can put into the `html` variable later on. I'll explain each one.

- **Line 1** - Displays all of your data from StatusCafe. You'll notice that it says that you don't have any statuses by default. This will only show if you don't have any posts in your StatusCafe. Otherwise, it will change.
- **Line 4** - displays your StatusCafe username along with the emoji picked when creating the post. Note the `NUMBER_OF_CHARACTERS` on the same line. This number should be equal to the number of characters in your username. However, if you want to include the emoji associated with the status, just add 3 to the number of characters in your username.
  - For example, my username "bechnokid" contains 9 characters. If I wanted to include the emoji, I would replace `NUMBER_OF_CHARACTERS` with 9 + 3, which would be 12.
  - The final line would then be the following:

```js
let title = el.querySelector("title").innerHTML.slice(0, 12).trim()
```

- **content** - Displays the full status. Self-explanatory.
- **dateString** - This is optional, but this displays the date when the status was posted. It will also display the full date instead of the "...days ago" that StatusCafe displays.

## Setting up the HTML

We will be adding the extracted data into the "html" variable that I previously mentioned.

This part requires the most customization as it entirely depends on how you want your feed to be displayed. For simplicity's sake, I'll use `<p>` tags.

Add the following underneath `let dateString = el.querySelector("published").innerHTML.slice(0,10)`:

```js
html += `
  <p>${title} - ${dateString}</p>
  <p>${content}`</p>
`;
```

This sets up the HTML of one of your posts, putting your username and the date on the first line, and then the status on the next line.

Then, place the following outside the `entries.forEach()` loop:

```js
document.getElementById("feed-reader").innerHTML = html;
```

This line will look for the HTML element with the id attribute `feed reader` and fill it with the data stored in the `html` variable.

## The Finished Code { #finished-html }

Putting the HTML and JS should look something like this:

```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <div id='feed-reader'></div>
    <script>
      const feedURL = 'https://status.cafe/users/[YOUR_STATUSCAFE_USERNAME].atom';
      fetch(feedURL)
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(str => new window.DOMParser().parseFromString(str, "text/xml"))
        .then(data => {
          const entries = data.querySelectorAll("entry");
          let html = (entries.length < 1) ? `<p>No statuses yet.</p>`: '';
          if (entries.length > 1){
            entries.forEach(el => {
              let title = el.querySelector("title").innerHTML.slice(0, NUMBER_OF_CHARACTERS).trim();
              let content = el.querySelector("content").textContent.trim();
              let dateString = el.querySelector("published").innerHTML.slice(0, 10);
              html += `
                <p>${title} - ${dateString}</p>
                <p>${content}</p>
              `;
            });
          }
          document.getElementById("feed-reader").innerHTML = html;
        })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Again, be sure to replace `YOUR_STATUSCAFE_USERNAME` near the top of the code with your StatusCafe username and `NUMBER_OF_CHARACTERS` with the number of characters in your StatusCafe username (+ 3 if you want to include the emoji).

## Finishing the Reader

Using the script above, your feed reader should look something like the following (without any formatting):

(Example feed is from [m15o](https://status.cafe/users/m15o), the main developer of StatusCafe)

{% codeDemo "Demo for a Status Cafe feed reader", height = "300" %}

```html
<div id="feed-reader" class="mt-4"></div>
```

```js
const feedURL = 'https://status.cafe/users/m15o.atom'
fetch(feedURL)
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then((str) => new window.DOMParser().parseFromString(str, "text/xml"))
  .then((data) => {
    const entries = data.querySelectorAll("entry");
    let html = (entries.length < 1) ? `<p>No statuses yet.</p>`: '';
    let title, content, dateString = ``;
    if (entries.length > 1){
      entries.forEach((el) => {
        title = el.querySelector("title").innerHTML.slice(0, 7).trim();
        content = el.querySelector("content").textContent.trim();
        dateString = el.querySelector("published").innerHTML.slice(0, 10);
        html += `<p>${title} - ${dateString}<p><p>${content}</p>`;
      });
    }
    document.getElementById("feed-reader").innerHTML = html;
  });
```

{% endcodeDemo %}

## (Optional) Shortening the Reader

Note that using the `forEach()` will loop through every post you made on StatusCafe. If you have more than fifty statuses, it can be overwhelming to scroll through a nearly endless list of statuses.

There are some options for this, such as implementing pagination, but the easiest (and my favorite) method is showing only a certain number of statuses. Let's say, for this example, that I only want to show 3 statuses from StatusCafe, and then provide a link to my StatusCafe account.

First, make the following changes:

1. Change `forEach()` into a `for` loop with an index
1. Change `el` within the loop to `entries[i]`

Applying the changes will change the loop into something like the following:

```js
for (i = 0; i < STATUS_LIMIT; i++) {
  let title = entries[i].querySelector("title").innerHTML.slice(0, NUMBER_OF_CHARACTERS).trim();
  let content = entries[i].querySelector("content").textContent.trim();
  let dateString = entries[i].querySelector("published").innerHTML.slice(0,10);
  html += `
    ${title} - ${dateString}
    ${content}
  `;
}
html += `<p><a href='https://status.cafe/users/m15o'>See more at StatusCafe</a></p>`;
document.getElementById("feed-reader").innerHTML = html;
```

You might have noticed that there is a new variable now: `STATUS_LIMIT`. This can be changed to the number of posts you want the feed reader to generate.

If we change this number to 3, the feed reader will generate 3 posts, resulting in the following:

{% codeDemo "Demo for a shortened Status Cafe feed reader", height = "275" %}

```html
<div id="feed-reader"></div>
```

```js
const feedURL = 'https://status.cafe/users/m15o.atom'
fetch(feedURL)
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then((str) => new window.DOMParser().parseFromString(str, "text/xml"))
  .then((data) => {
    const entries = data.querySelectorAll("entry");
    let html = (entries.length < 1) ? `<p>No statuses yet.</p>`: '';
    let title, content, dateString = ``;
    if (entries.length > 1){
      let statusLimit = 3;
      if (entries.length < statusLimit) statusLimit = entries.length;
      for (i = 0; i < statusLimit; i++) {
        title = entries[i].querySelector("title").innerHTML.slice(0, 7).trim();
        content = entries[i].querySelector("content").textContent.trim();
        dateString = entries[i].querySelector("published").innerHTML.slice(0, 10);
        html += `<p>${title} - ${dateString}<p><p>${content}</p>`;
      }
      html += `<p><a href='https://status.cafe/users/m15o'>See more at StatusCafe</a></p>`;
    }
    document.getElementById("feed-reader").innerHTML = html;
  });
```

{% endcodeDemo %}

## Closing Thoughts

Thank you for reading this tutorial! Like I said previously, it is entirely possible to use an iframe with StatusCafe as its source, but I've started to enjoy this method just for its customization options. Regardless, I hope you find this useful!
